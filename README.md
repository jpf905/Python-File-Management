# About Me
Greetings everyone! My name is John Flanagan. This README will give you a little bit of information about me.

## My Career Passions
I am a junior back-end engineer and data scientist. I have a passion for the integration and role of mathematics within both computational and data science fields. I am traditionally taught as a Mathematician and self-taught as a Full-Stack developer. One of the reasons I decided to go into tech is that I always love learning new things. I thrive on my mind being engaged and active. Although my training in full stack development has been a little over a year, I have loved it from the beginning. Online resources (e.g., Codecamdey) and others have helped me so much in my pursuit of a new career and area of study.
Alongside my work within the tech industry, I am also an experienced educator, professional classical musician, and athletic coach.

## My Hobbies
My hobbies and interests are varied. I enjoy reading, classical music, standup paddleboarding, snorkeling, working out, and BJJ.
